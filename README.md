# My collection of Home Assistant Blueprints

In this repo, you will find my personal Home Assistant Blueprints. As of now, it includes two different ZHA items.

## Getting Started

The blueprints can be added from Home Assistant using the links below.

## List of blueprints

### ZHA - Aqara Opple Wireless Scene Switch 6 Button 
The Aqara WXCJKG13LM comes with 6 buttons which intuitively can be used to control 3 different lights or groups, with each corresponding bands.

The blueprint is setup as follow:

* Left button: Turn on light
* Right button: Turn off light
* Hold left button: Increase brightness
* Hold right button: Decrease brightness

As well as manual configuration for each of the buttons double press and triple press, if this functionality is needed.

#### TO-DO
I want to add the possibility to use switches, covers etc. in the future. As of now, the blueprint is setup for ease of use, not customizability. Feel free to contribute to add. This can however easily be achieved, by modifying the blueprint.
